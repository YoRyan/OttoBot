# Otto the F# Bot

This is a personal Discord bot of mine written using F# (the best high-level programming language in the world) and [NetCord](https://netcord.dev) (the best Discord library in the world). Although the bot is not available for public use, I have open-sourced it so that it might help other programmers write their own F# bots.

To run Otto, supply the following environment variables:

- `TOKEN`: the Discord API token (mandatory)
- `GUILD_ID`: if supplied, the bot will register its commands with this guild instead of globally
