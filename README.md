# Otto Bot

This is a personal Discord bot of mine written using F# and Discord.Net. Although it is not a public bot, I have open-sourced it so that it might help other programmers write their own F# bots.

The bot is structured similarly to a normal Discord.Net bot, just with F# instead of C#. The most difficult part was translating between C# Task and F# Async. You can peruse all of the gory details in the source code...

To run Otto, supply the bot's API token in the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable.
